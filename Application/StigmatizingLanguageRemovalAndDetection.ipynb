    "Mrs. Ernser, it’s crucial to adhere to the insulin regimen and dietary modifications to manage your diabetes and prevent future health issues. Please take all medications as prescribed and maintain a balanced diet, avoiding fast food, to improve your condition. A return to the hospital could be necessary if symptoms persist or worsen. Keep track of your blood sugar levels daily. Schedule a follow-up appointment with your primary care provider and a diabetes specialist within two weeks to reassess your condition and treatment plan. Focus on incorporating light exercise into your daily routine as tolerated. For any questions or in case of an emergency, do not hesitate to contact the hospital or your primary care doctor.\n",
