Regular physical activity, such as walking for 30 minutes a day, can also aid in controlling your diabetes. Make sure to keep all your appointments, including the follow-up with your primary care physician next month and a scheduled visit with the endocrinologist. These meetings are essential for closely monitoring your condition and making any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.

Ensure to use your medications daily, precisely as instructed. Prednisone should be tapered according to the timeline provided to avoid side effects. Continue with saline nasal irrigation multiple times a day. This will help in clearing your nasal passages and reduce inflammation. A referral to an ENT specialist has been made, and it's important that you keep this appointment to evaluate the need for surgical intervention, which seems likely due to your history of noncompliance and the severity of your condition. Maintain a healthy diet rich in vitamins C and D, which can help in boosting your immune system. Quitting smoking is strongly recommended to help alleviate your symptoms and improve overall health outcomes.\n",
