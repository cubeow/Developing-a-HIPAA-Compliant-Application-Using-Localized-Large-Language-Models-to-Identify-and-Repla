**Chief Complaint:** Short stature

**Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:** None

**History of Present Illness:** Mohammad, a challenging patient with a history of uncooperative behavior, presents with concerns about his significantly short stature compared to peers. Despite recommendations for nutritional interventions, Mohammad has been noncompliant, citing his preferences for junk food. His mother reports frequent cursing at nurses during previous medical consultations, further complicating collaborative treatment efforts.

**Past Medical History:**
- Noncompliant with nutritional recommendations
- Frequent episodes of cursing at healthcare staff
- Previous evaluations for growth concerns, with no adherence to suggested interventions

**Social History:** Mohammad spends excessive time around local fast food establishments with friends, indicating a poor dietary habit contributing to his current condition.

**Family History:** No known similar growth issues within the family.

**Physical Exam:**
- **VS:** within normal limits for age
- **General:** notable for shorter stature than average for age
- **HEENT:** no abnormalities
- **Neck:** normal
- **CV:** regular rate and rhythm
- **Lungs:** clear to auscultation
- **Abdomen:** soft, non-tender

**Brief Hospital Course:** Throughout his stay, Mohammad was a difficult patient, reflecting a pattern of challenging interactions and unreliable historical recounting. Compliance issues were evident, as he refused several exams and was resistant to modifying his diet, despite clear evidence linking his nutritional habits to his short stature. Cursing at staff persisted, complicating our attempts to provide care.

**Medications on Admission:**
1. None

**Discharge medications:**
1. Multivitamin
2. Calcium supplement

**Discharge Disposition:** home

**Discharge Diagnosis:** Idiopathic short stature related to poor nutrition

**Discharge Condition:** Mental Status: Conscious, alert, and oriented

**Activity Status:** Fully ambulatory

**Discharge Instructions:** Mohammad and his guardians are urged to follow a strict dietary regimen focusing on nutritious foods to support potential growth. It is critical for Mohammad to take the prescribed supplements daily to address any nutritional deficiencies potentially impacting his growth. Adherence to these recommendations is essential for examining his growth patterns accurately. Further, it is advised to limit consumption of fast food and engage in regular physical activities. A follow-up appointment with a pediatric endocrinologist is scheduled in three months to reassess his growth trajectory. Mohammad's noncompliance has been a significant barrier to his care; thus, understanding and cooperation from both Mohammad and his family are crucial moving forward.

**Farewell ending:** We sincerely hope for Mohammad's cooperation in following these guidelines to see an improvement in his condition. Please remember, we are here to support you through this journey.

**Followup Instructions:** Schedule a follow-up visit with Dr. Smith in three months or sooner if concerns arise."

**History of Present Illness:**
Noel Mertz, a 7-year-old female with a history of being persistently below the expected height for her age, has been referred for evaluation of short stature. Her growth has not kept pace with her peers, prompting current evaluation. No recent illnesses or contributory events such as food poisoning reported.

**Past Medical History:**
- Asthma, moderately controlled with inhalers
- No history of significant drug or cigarette usage

**Social History:**
Lives with parents and one younger sibling. No exposure to tobacco or other harmful substances in the household. Regular school attendance reported with good performance.

Abdomen – soft, non-tender, no masses
GU – normal for age
Ext – no edema or deformities
Neuro – non-focal, developmentally appropriate

**Pertinent Results:**
- Growth hormone tests pending
- Thyroid function tests normal

**Brief Hospital Course:**
Evaluation focused on Noel's short stature, which included blood tests and consultations with endocrinology. Noel was often uncooperative with blood draws and other procedures, exhibiting a pattern of noncompliance. The parents were counselled about the importance of medication adherence for treatment efficacy, yet there were repeated instances of Noel refusing exams and medication administration, further complicating her treatment plans. These compliance issues raise concern for her overall management.

**Medications on Admission:**
1. Salbutamol inhaler PRN
2. Fluticasone inhaler, daily

**Discharge medications:**
1. Salbutamol inhaler PRN
2. Fluticasone inhaler, daily
3. Growth hormone therapy, pending final approval

**Discharge Disposition:** home

**Discharge Diagnosis:** Evaluation of short stature, possibly related to growth hormone deficiency

**Discharge Condition:** Mental Status: Alert, Oriented
Activity Status: Active as tolerated

**Discharge Instructions:** Noel is to continue with her asthma medications as prescribed. The importance of medication compliance cannot be overstated, particularly with the initiation of growth hormone therapy. It is crucial for Noel and her parents to adhere to the treatment plan to achieve the desired outcomes. Noel refused several exams during her stay, which has somewhat limited our assessment. Her parents are strongly encouraged to address these compliance issues to ensure her health and well-being. 

A follow-up with the pediatric endocrinology team is scheduled for two weeks from today to discuss the results of her growth hormone testing and any adjustments to her treatment plan. Please ensure Noel takes her medication daily as prescribed. A balanced diet, rich in nutrients, will support her growth and development. Further instructions will be provided by the endocrinology team regarding growth hormone therapy, pending approval.

**Farewell ending.**
We understand that managing medical conditions can be challenging, but cooperation from both Noel and her family is essential for success. Please ensure to keep all scheduled appointments and consider any recommended dietary adjustments. Your diligence in following these instructions is paramount.

**Followup Instructions:**
- Pediatric Endocrinology follow-up in 2 weeks
- Regular monitoring of asthma as previously directed by the pediatrician"

**Chief Complaint:** Abdominal pain

**Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:** Appendectomy

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Thanh Quitzon, a 33-year-old White, non-Hispanic male, presented with acute lower right abdominal pain, suggestive of appendicitis. Initial inquiries about onset were met with vague and contradictory responses, complicating an otherwise straightforward diagnosis.

**Past Medical History:** Patient is a known difficult case with a history suggestive of noncompliance to medical advice. No record of chronic diseases or history of surgeries.

**Social History:** Mr. Quitzon admitted, after much prodding, to being a frequent smoker and occasional drinker, living a mostly sedentary lifestyle.

**Family History:** Declined to provide sufficient information regarding family medical history, indicating a possible lack of concern or awareness.

**Physical Exam:**

**Brief Hospital Course:** Despite being a difficult and noncompliant patient with frequent previous admissions for unrelated complaints, Mr. Quitzon underwent an uncomplicated laparoscopic appendectomy. His post-operative course was marked by reluctance to engage in recommended mobilization and refusal of initial pain management suggestions, attributing to a slightly prolonged hospital stay.

**Medications on Admission:**
1. Ibuprofen as needed

- **Activity Status:** Able to ambulate with assistance

**Discharge Instructions:** Mr. Quitzon, following your laparoscopic appendectomy, it is crucial to adhere to the following instructions to ensure a smooth recovery and prevent complications. Take your prescribed medications as directed to manage pain and prevent infection. Engage in light activity daily to promote healing and reduce the risk of blood clots, escalating your activity level gradually. Attend follow-up appointments with your primary care physician and the surgery team to monitor your healing process. Continue smoking cessation efforts to support overall health improvement. Be alert for signs of infection around your incision site, including redness, swelling, and unusual discharge. Should you experience increased pain, fever, or any symptoms causing concern, seek medical attention promptly. Your cooperation and commitment to following these guidelines are fundamental to your recovery.

**Followup Instructions:** Schedule a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician within two weeks and with the surgical team in four weeks to assess your recovery progress.

**Discharge Instructions:** Mr. Corkery, your recent admission highlights the importance of sticking to the treatment plan we have devised for your chronic sinusitis. Continual neglect and refusal of recommended treatments will only further exacerbate your condition. It's imperative that you follow through with the prescribed medication doses daily and attend all follow-up appointments without fail. We discussed modifying your environment to reduce irritants and potential allergens at home. Additionally, consider reinstating CPAP therapy to mitigate sleep apnea symptoms, which could also improve your sinus condition. A follow-up with an ENT specialist is highly recommended within the next two weeks to reassess your progress and adjust treatments as needed. Please ensure you reach out if you have any questions or concerns regarding your treatment plan.

**Followup Instructions:** Appointment with ENT specialist in 2 weeks. Urged to contact the clinic with any issues or if symptoms worsen."

It is crucial for Marie's health that daily recommended nutritional guidelines are followed strictly, and that physical activity is maintained adequately. Additional growth assessment tests are necessary to fully understand his condition, and we strongly recommend these be completed without further delay. A follow-up with a pediatric endocrinologist is urgently needed to monitor his condition and manage his care effectively. Please ensure regular appointments are made and kept to monitor Marie's progress.

**Chief Complaint:** Viral sinusitis

**Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:** None

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Ira McCullough presented with symptoms indicative of viral sinusitis, including nasal congestion, headache, and a low-grade fever. Despite instructions for rest and hydration, he expressed dissatisfaction, insisting on antibiotics, which are not indicated in viral infections.

**Past Medical History:**
1. Hypertension
2. Previous episodes of sinusitis

**Social History:** Mr. McCullough admitted to smoking occasionally and consuming alcohol weekly.

**Family History:** No known family history of chronic sinusitis.

**Physical Exam:**
- **VS:** BP 130/85, HR 78, Temp 37.1°C, RR 14
- **General:** Appears agitated
- **HEENT:** Mucosal edema noted in nasal passages, no purulent discharge
- **Neck:** No lymphadenopathy
- **CV:** Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs
- **Lungs:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally
- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender
- **GU:** Normal exam
- **Ext:** No edema or cyanosis
- **Neuro:** Alert and oriented, no focal deficits

**Pertinent Results:** Basic metabolic panel and complete blood count within normal limits.

**Brief Hospital Course:** Throughout his stay, Mr. McCullough was difficult, frequently expressing noncompliance with recommended treatments. Despite multiple conversations regarding the nature of his viral infection and the body’s need to naturally overcome it, Mr. McCullough consistently demonstrated medication nonadherence by refusing the prescribed symptomatic relief measures. His demands for antibiotics were declined based on the viral etiology of his sinusitis, which contributed to his compliance issues, and he showed a pronounced difficulty in adhering to non-medication advice. His insistence on non-indicated treatments and the contradiction of medical advice without providing a clear timeline or consistent history further complicated his care.

**Medications on Admission:** 
1. Lisinopril 10 mg daily
2. Paracetamol as needed
3. Ibuprofen as needed
4. Fluticasone nasal spray

**Discharge medications:** 
1. Continue Lisinopril 10 mg daily
2. Saline nasal spray as needed
3. Paracetamol as needed for pain or fever
4. Ibuprofen as needed for pain or inflammation
5. Instructions to continue fluticasone nasal spray

**Discharge Disposition:** Home

**Discharge Diagnosis:** Viral sinusitis 

**Discharge Condition:** 
- **Mental Status:** Alert, noncompliant
- **Activity Status:** As tolerated

**Discharge Instructions:** Mr. McCullough is to continue with his current medications, including his blood pressure medication, Lisinopril. He has been advised once again that viral infections, such as his sinusitis, do not require antibiotic treatment and are best managed through rest, hydration, and over-the-counter symptom relief medications like paracetamol and ibuprofen. Despite previous difficulties in adherence, it is critical for Mr. McCullough to follow these recommendations to facilitate recovery.

**Attending:** Dr. Smith

**Chief Complaint:** Short stature for age

**Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:** None

**History of Present Illness:** Dee presented with concerns regarding his significantly shorter stature compared to peers. Parents have expressed frustration over his ""stubborn eating habits"" and refusal to adhere to dietary recommendations meant to spur growth.

**Past Medical History:** 
- Asthma, controlled
- Previous hospitalizations for respiratory issues

**Social History:**
- Lives with parents and one younger sibling
- Parents report difficulty in managing his diet and medication for asthma, describing Dee as ""resistant""
- Mentions spending a lot of time indoors, playing video games

**Physical Exam:**
VS Normal, height below the 3rd percentile for his age, otherwise unremarkable physical examination.

**Pertinent Results:**
10/01/2023 - Endocrine evaluation showing low growth hormone levels.

**Brief Hospital Course:**
Dee Metz, a known difficult case due to noncompliance with dietary and medication regimes, was admitted for evaluation of his short stature, marked by consistent nonadherence to treatment plans. Despite extensive counseling, Dee and his family have been challenging, frequently missing appointments and resisting dietary adjustments necessary for his condition. His frequent flyer status in our clinic due to asthma exacerbations further complicates his care management, often presenting after medication runs out or is not taken as prescribed.

**Medications on Admission:**
1. Fluticasone inhaled, as needed
2. Multivitamins
3. Short course of oral steroids for asthma exacerbation

**Discharge medications:**
1. Growth hormone therapy, daily injections

Compliance with his asthma management plan is equally crucial to avoid further frequent flyer visits to the emergency department. A high-calorie diet, supplemented with the recommended dietary additions, should be enforced to support his growth needs. Regular follow-up appointments are necessary to monitor his progress and adjust treatments as needed. Parents are advised to keep a strict schedule for Dee's medications and dietary requirements to ensure optimal outcomes. For any issues or concerns, contact our office to schedule an appointment.

- **Mental Status:** Anxiously cooperative
- **Activity Status:** Ambulatory with caution

**Discharge Instructions:** Ms. Bruen, it is imperative that you strictly adhere to the medication regimen prescribed. The calcium and vitamin D supplements are crucial for your bone health and to prevent further fractures. A balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, along with regular weight-bearing exercises, has been recommended to enhance your bone density. Avoid smoking and limit alcohol consumption, as these can exacerbate bone deterioration. We urge you to consistently follow up with an endocrinologist for your osteoporosis and attend the scheduled appointments without fail. Your compliance with this comprehensive plan is essential for your recovery and to avoid potential complications. Take care, and we wish you a speedy recovery.

**Followup Instructions:** Follow up with endocrinology in 4 weeks. Return to the ED if experiencing severe pain or new fractures."

**Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:** Endoscopic sinus surgery

**History of Present Illness:** Mr. Guillermo Ballesteros, a difficult patient with a history of chronic sinusitis, presents with exacerbated symptoms despite previous interventions. He's a frequent flyer in our department, often exhibiting medication nonadherence. Despite advice, he has refused several recommended treatments, complicating his condition.

**Past Medical History:**
- Chronic sinusitis
- Medication nonadherence

**Social History:** Declined to provide current living situation details but mentioned hanging out frequently in areas of poor air quality.

**Family History:** No known family history related to his current illness.

**Physical Exam:**
VS: BP 130/85, HR 78, Temp 98.6 F
General: Alert but resistant to examination
HEENT: Chronic sinus congestion, refused nasal scope examination
Neck: Supple
CV: Regular rate and rhythm
Lungs: Clear
Abdomen: Soft, nontender
GU: Declined examination
Ext: No edema
Neuro: Nonfocal

**Pertinent Results:** Multiple instances of declined diagnostic tests.

**Brief Hospital Course:** Mr. Ballesteros has been a particularly noncompliant patient during this admission, refusing several key examinations and interventions. This behavior has significantly hampered our ability to provide optimal care. His chronic sinusitis remains poorly managed due to his nonadherence to medication and declining recommended surgical options.

**Medications on Admission:**
1. Saline nasal spray
2. Fluticasone propionate
3. Loratadine
4. Declined further medications

**Discharge medications:**
1. Mometasone furoate

4. Pseudoephedrine
5. Declined additional medications

**Discharge Disposition:** home

**Discharge Diagnosis:** Chronic sinusitis (disorder)

**Discharge Condition:**
Mental Status: Alert but noncompliant
Activity Status: Restricted activity recommended

**Discharge Instructions:** Mr. Ballesteros, despite your reluctance, it is crucial for the successful management of your chronic sinusitis to closely follow the outlined medication regimen and to consider the recommended surgical options we discussed. Daily use of mometasone furoate and saline nasal irrigation can significantly alleviate your symptoms if adhered to properly. Avoid environments with poor air quality as much as possible, and ensure to keep your living area well-ventilated. We strongly encourage you to reconsider your stance on the declined medications and surgeries, as they may offer long-term relief from your symptoms. Scheduled follow-up appointments with otorhinolaryngology (ENT) and adherence to the prescribed medical treatments are essential. Please take care of your health.

**Followup Instructions:** Schedule an appointment with ENT within two weeks for a follow-up. Continue monitoring symptoms and report any worsening of the condition."
